# Sentiment Analysis With SpaCy

A project to learn more about the process of a machine learning solution and to learn about Natural Language Processing (NLP).

**Note: The model isn't always as accurate. This was mainly for learning NLP and because of hardware limitations, I only trained the model for about 2.5 hours which is too low to always get accurate results.**

Tools and Softwares I used: Python, SpaCy, Pandas and Streamlit

Dataset that was utilized: https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140
